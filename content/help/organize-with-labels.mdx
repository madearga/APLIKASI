Labels are a lightweight way to group content in APLIKASIKITA. You can attach labels to pages, sections, and media so busy workspaces stay searchable.

## What is a label?

A label is a color-coded marker you can assign to any item in a workspace. Labels make it simple to filter deliverables by status, owner, or campaign.

With labels, you can:

1. Organize content by client, sprint, or handoff state.
2. Filter lists to share just the items your stakeholders need.
3. Update or retire labels with an inline, Notion-style menu.

## Create a label

Open any page or asset drawer, click the label field, and type the name you want to use.

If the label already exists you can select it. Otherwise press `Enter ↩` to create a new one and APLIKASIKITA will suggest a color automatically.

## Edit or delete a label

Labels live in the workspace sidebar. Hover over any label to reveal the `⋮` menu—rename it, switch colors, or remove it entirely. Changes apply everywhere the label is used.

## Assign multiple labels

You can add up to three labels per item today. Need more? Let us know in the in-app feedback panel—we’re collecting votes for unlimited labels.

## Label limits

Label capacity depends on your plan:

- **Starter**: Up to 10 active labels per workspace
- **Growth**: Unlimited labels, plus label-based automations
- **Scale**: Unlimited labels with access control and audit history

Want automations or shared label presets across clients? Reach out to the APLIKASIKITA team—we’d love to hear how you’re organizing your work.
