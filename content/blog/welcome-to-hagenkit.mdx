Welcome to APLIKASIKITA—the fastest way for agencies, studios, and in-house teams to ship production-ready websites with AI support and human control.

## Why APLIKASIKITA?

Unlike prompt-only builders or rigid templates, APLIKASIKITA pairs guided workflows with smart defaults. You start with your brand voice, design direction, and goals—our AI handles the heavy lifting while you stay in charge of final approvals.

- **Launch in minutes**: Transform an existing site or start fresh with conversational onboarding.
- **Workspaces built for teams**: Manage multiple clients, assign roles, and keep context organized.
- **Consistent brand guardrails**: Lock typography, colors, and component patterns once, then reuse everywhere.
- **Review-ready previews**: Share interactive drafts with stakeholders and capture feedback inline.

## A guided process from brief to launch

1. **Discover & align** – Answer a short series of questions about the audience, tone, and desired outcomes. APLIKASIKITA maps those answers to component layouts and content outlines.
2. **Generate & adapt** – AI drafts sections, copy, and imagery that follow your brand guardrails. Tweak anything live—no prompt wrangling required.
3. **Review & approve** – Share secure preview links, gather comments, and apply edits with built-in versioning.
4. **Launch & iterate** – Publish to APLIKASIKITA hosting, connect a custom domain, or export the codebase when you need a handoff.
