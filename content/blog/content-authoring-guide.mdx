<Note variant="info">
  Welcome, contributors! This public playbook keeps humans and language models aligned on how to plan, draft, and review new
  APLIKASIKITA articles. Reference it whenever you brief an LLM or open a pull request.
</Note>

## Why this guide lives in the blog archive

Moving the authoring guide into the blog makes it discoverable to every contributor who subscribes to APLIKASIKITA updates. It
sits alongside launch announcements, changelog recaps, and community stories, so new collaborators can learn our content
workflow without digging through internal help folders. Treat it like a living blog post—open a PR whenever the process evolves.

## Keep the content collection contributor-friendly

- **Normalize metadata.** Every collection should expose `seoTitle`, `seoDescription`, and `seoKeywords` so search listings
  use consistent titles, descriptions, and keyword clusters.
- **Ensure fallbacks.** When writers forget to provide SEO fields, fall back to the title, summary, or integration description
  to avoid empty meta tags.
- **Track supporting embeds.** Continue collecting images, tweets, and GitHub repository references so we can programmatically
  build rich previews and structured data.

These improvements are already wired into the collection transforms so the metadata is hydrated even when optional fields are
missing. 【F:content-collections.ts†L23-L114】【F:content-collections.ts†L150-L253】【F:content-collections.ts†L255-L343】

## How to plan new articles

Whether you're writing a blog update or a help center fix, start with the same foundation:

1. **Kickoff & outline** – Define the audience, search intent, success metric, and desired call-to-action.
2. **Collect assets** – Gather quotes, stats, screenshots, and links so the LLM can ground its responses.
3. **Prep the brief** – Provide the outline, audience, target keywords, and required embeds when prompting an LLM.
4. **Draft collaboratively** – Ask the model for unique headlines, summaries, and metadata, then iterate on tone and clarity.

## Workflow specifics for blog posts

1. **Kickoff & outline**
   - Define the audience, search intent, and desired call-to-action.
   - Gather supporting assets (quotes, stats, screenshots) and confirm they align with permitted categories.
2. **Drafting**
   - Start from a template that includes frontmatter, hero image, summary, and CTA.
   - Provide the LLM with the outline, audience, target keywords, and any mandatory embeds.
   - Request unique headlines (`seoTitle`), meta descriptions, and a 160-character summary for the SERP snippet.
3. **Review**
   - Fact-check numbers, links, and quotes.
   - Verify that images have alt text, callouts use the right variant, and MDX syntax validates locally.
4. **Final polish**
   - Populate `seoKeywords` with 3–6 comma-separated phrases.
   - Cross-link two or more related posts in the body copy and `related` array.

## Workflow specifics for help center articles

1. **Problem framing** – Capture the customer question, the product surface area, and the expected resolution state.
2. **LLM brief** – Supply the model with:
   - Feature description
   - Step-by-step actions (with UI labels)
   - Screenshots to embed via `<Image />`
   - Any warnings or prerequisites for `<Note variant="warning" />`
3. **Structure response** – Use short paragraphs, ordered lists for sequential steps, and add `<Prerequisites>` or
   `<Summary>` components when appropriate.
4. **SEO checks** – Confirm `seoDescription` is customer-focused and that headings use target verbs ("Configure",
   "Connect", "Troubleshoot").

## Frontmatter reference

| Field | Required | Collections | Guidance |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `title` | ✅ | All | Keep under 60 characters and front-load the keyword. |
| `summary` | ✅ | Blog, Help, Changelog, Customers, Integrations | Compose 1–2 sentences that answer the primary intent. |
| `seoTitle` | ➕ | All | Customize when the on-page title is longer than ideal SERP length. Falls back to `title`. |
| `seoDescription` | ➕ | All | Use 150–160 character, action-oriented summaries. Falls back to the summary or integration description. |
| `seoKeywords` | ➕ | All | List the main keyword phrase plus supporting modifiers (no more than six). |
| `related` | ➕ | Blog, Help | Provide slugs for cross-linking. |

## Available MDX components

You can use the following JSX components inside MDX files. They are already registered in the MDX provider.

| Component | Usage |
| --------- | ----- |
| `<Note variant="info"\|"warning"\|"success">` | Highlight tips, cautions, or success states. |
| `<Quote>` | Showcase customer testimonials with avatars and company logos. |
| `<Prerequisites>` | Summarize requirements before readers follow a workflow. |
| `<CopyBox>` | Provide copy-to-clipboard values (API keys, URLs, etc.). |
| `<GithubRepo>` | Link to supporting repositories with consistent styling. |
| `<HelpArticles>` & `<HelpCategories>` | Cross-promote other documentation entries. |
| `<Tweet>` | Embed tweets with a graceful fallback. |
| `<Stepper>` | Break complex workflows into numbered steps with optional imagery. |
| `<Example>` | Walk through numeric calculations or scenarios. |
| `<Summary>` | Present key takeaways in a two-column grid. |
| `<CTA>` | Drop in a polished call-to-action module. |
| `<DcfChart>` | Render financial charts where relevant. |
| `<Image>` | Automatically wraps screenshots with zoom and blurhash loading. |

Refer to the MDX provider for the full implementation details, styling, and helper imports. 【F:components/blog/mdx.tsx†L1-L456】

## Component ideas to explore next

The MDX provider already covers most contributor needs, but the community has requested more storytelling patterns—video
walkthroughs, animated metrics, comparison blocks, and accordion FAQs. Building composable `<Video>`, `<ComparisonTable>`,
`<StatsGrid>`, and `<Accordion>` components would diversify layouts and showcase richer narratives. Start with
statically-rendered variants and progressively enhance once the styling foundation is in place. 【F:components/blog/mdx.tsx†L1-L456】

## Prompt checklist for LLM-assisted drafting

1. Supply the model with the frontmatter template and explain every field.
2. Paste this component reference so the model knows which JSX tags are supported.
3. Include search intent, reader persona, CTA, and any forbidden phrases.
4. Ask for:
   - A `seoTitle` under 60 characters
   - A `seoDescription` under 160 characters
   - Body copy with scannable headings and inlined component usage instructions
5. Review the output and request revisions before pasting into the repository.

Keeping this briefing consistent prevents hallucinated components and guarantees every article ships with complete metadata.
